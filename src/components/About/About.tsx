              I started to get interested in Dev at the age of 16 years old, I wanted to start by creating bots discord, after that I saw that it was not as simple as I thought ðŸ˜…, 
              so I moved to Web development, I started, then I quickly stopped.

              Since the arrival of AI, I've understood that it's a very powerful tool for learning, and to get where I am, I'd NEVER HAVE ARRIVED SO FAST WITHOUT IT.
              And thanks to it, I've quickly become paterfamilias, and seeing ideas in my head come to life gives me a dose of adrenalin...

              Today I continue to do my projects in my corner, I sometimes hesitate to launch into freelancing to do other people's projects, 
              but I always block myself because I have the studies.
            </p>
            <p className="ps">ps: I still use AI for help me ðŸ‘€</p>
